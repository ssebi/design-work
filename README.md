# Design work

I'll leave the boring parts out and go straight to my favourite project where I've contributed the most. We were a startup company who was building a ticketing platform (keyvent.com) for which we needed to create two mobile apps (four if you count the Android apps). One of the apps, the one with the highest priority was used to scan user's tickets which contained a QR code at the event entrance and the second app was created to discover events and purchase tickets with ease.

We'll focus on the second app, the one where users can discover events and purchase tickets since that one was more complex.

## The process

### Wireframes

I've started by doing some wireframes/low fidelity mock-ups which changed a lot at the beginning. Here are some examples of what they looked like:

zoom into the checkout section:

### Design screens

After we've discussed all the use-cases, the edge-cases and we've committed to the final version of the app's features, I've started to work on the high fidelity design screens. 

One note about the design is that I've tried to create a universal design for both iOS and Android version of the app because I was a single person and it would've been too much work to create different designs for both platforms. That's how I try to justify the decision of the hamburger menu.

### Icons

I've manually created all icons and graphics in the apps. Probably time wasted but I've enjoyed it.
